## ABOUT:
High-throughput phenotyping technologies have revolutionised plant science by using advanced imaging and sensor-based measurements to generate large-scale, high-resolution data on plant traits under diverse conditions. However, analysing and interpreting this data is labour-intensive and requires advanced statistical and computational techniques. This pioneering study uses Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism to apply topological manifold learning within both Euclidean and hyperbolic (Poincaré ball) geometries to represent plant growth under multifactorial stress conditions. We reveal hidden patterns and interactions among factors by integrating feature reduction, innovative covering strategies, and tailored clustering. Our findings show that the Poincaré ball method significantly outperforms Euclidean models, providing profound insights into the dynamic interplay of stress factors affecting plant phenotypes. These results underscore the potential of hyperbolic geometry in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), setting new benchmarks in plant phenomics and paving the way for novel explorations of biological systems through geometric structures

Comparative Frameworks of Euclidean vs. Hyperbolic Mapper Pipelines for Arabidopsis Thaliana Data Analysis. This illustration is bifurcated to detail the separate analytical pathways employed for plant-derived descriptors and high-resolution image datasets, utilising both Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. (A) Depicts the Euclidean Mapper pipeline for plant-derived descriptors, starting with UMAP for feature reduction, proceeding through a cubical cover function, and finalising with clustering to form the Mapper graph. (B) Highlights the pathway for image datasets within Euclidean space, where embeddings generated via Euclidean contrastive learning techniques are segmented by a cubical cover and clustered to produce the Mapper graph. The diagram's right segment introduces the Hyperbolic Mapper strategy, (C) for plant-derived descriptors, incorporating hyperbolic UMAP for feature reduction onto the Poincar'e Ball, followed by our proprietary Poincar'e Ball cover function and hyperbolic clustering to yield the Mapper graph. (D) Illustrates the approach for image datasets in Hyperbolic space, where Hyperbolic contrastive learning yields Poincar'e Disk embeddings, subsequently processed using the identical cover function and clustering mechanism as in (C). This juxtaposition underscores the nuanced but significant distinctions and synergies between Euclidean and Hyperbolic Mapper methodologies in uncovering complex patterns and phenotypic variations within Arabidopsis datasets.
