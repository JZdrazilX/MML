## ABOUT:
High-throughput phenotyping technologies have revolutionised plant science by using advanced imaging and sensor-based measurements to generate large-scale, high-resolution data on plant traits under diverse conditions. However, analysing and interpreting this data is labour-intensive and requires advanced statistical and computational techniques. This pioneering study uses Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism to apply topological manifold learning within both Euclidean and hyperbolic (Poincaré ball) geometries to represent plant growth under multifactorial stress conditions. We reveal hidden patterns and interactions among factors by integrating feature reduction, innovative covering strategies, and tailored clustering. Our findings show that the Poincaré ball method significantly outperforms Euclidean models, providing profound insights into the dynamic interplay of stress factors affecting plant phenotypes. These results underscore the potential of hyperbolic geometry in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), setting new benchmarks in plant phenomics and paving the way for novel explorations of biological systems through geometric structures
